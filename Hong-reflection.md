#Reflections

What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  The correct way to submit and approve a pull request

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  How to approve a pull request, how to setup a pull request, general logistics of GitHub, and generally just feeling comfortable with the website.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  Proper ways to use new commands like git fetch and git merge, what these commands do exactly in a more specific way, how to go about the GPS modules correctly in pace and thoroughness.
What still confuses you about Git?
  Some minor formatting formalities in editing and making markdown files for the most part. Keeping track of the proper Git flow is something that hopefully will come more naturally the more I use Git- it's not as second nature as I would like it to be yet.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  It was confusing at first, but it got better as the session went along. To this end Helin was very helpful in pointing us in the right direction, and even helped me look up the solution to a configuration problem with my console. Thanks to David and Helin.
