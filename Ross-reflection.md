#Realease 7

*I was struggling with alot of the merging proceedures. Knowing what to type into the terminal for pushing a branch and pulling a branch.
* Git basics and github navigation were clarified during the GPS. 
* I asked alot of questions but mostly about what syntax to use in the terminal. Also how to reference git for command help using "--help".
* I understand how to use github to an extent. I still need to practice this till its second nature but I'm aware I'll be exposed to much more github.
* My experience with pairing was awesome. There was alot of confusion but having other people there to help with questions made it a learning environment.
